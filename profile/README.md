## Core Tools

These general tools drive the rest of our infrastructure. They’re designed to be fast, efficient, and (relatively) easy to use.

| Name | Purpose | License |
|------|---------|---------|
| **[Ensemble](https://github.com/just-every/ensemble)** | Unified interface to all major LLMs. | MIT |
| **[Task](https://github.com/just-every/task)** | Expands Ensemble to perform intelligent, reflective task execution. | MIT |
| **[Magi](https://github.com/just-every/magi)** | Orchestrates Tasks with a persistent chain of thought — Mostly Autonomous Generative Intelligence. | MIT |

## Focused Tools

These tools are designed for specific tasks and outcomes.

| Name | Purpose | License |
|------|---------|---------|
| **[Code](https://github.com/just-every/code)** | Command-line coding agent (maintained fork of `openai/codex`). | Apache-2.0 |
| **[MCP Tools](https://github.com/orgs/just-every/repositories?q=mcp)** | A growing set of MCP tools to speed up development. | MIT |
| **[Search](https://github.com/just-every/search)** | Meta search engine that queries multiple providers at once. | MIT |
| **[Crawl](https://github.com/just-every/crawl)** | Read pages/sites and convert to clean Markdown fast. | MIT |
| **[Code Context](https://github.com/just-every/code-context)** | Analyzes a repo’s architecture/history to unlock truly autonomous code integration. | MIT |
| **[Benchmark](https://github.com/just-every/benchmark)** | Benchmarks on Ensemble/Task to compare models and features. | MIT |

## Post-Scarcity Pledge

We believe that with the right direction **AI can create post-scarcity** — a world where hunger, homelessness, and preventable disease are solved problems. That might sound like utopia, but two years ago today’s tech looked like science fiction.

We’re well past the point where regulation can catch up. The only way out is through — faster, more open, more intentional. We must build tools that solve the problems they create.

**If you're building commercially:**  
You’re not required to, but we ask you to consider joining our Post-Scarcity Pledge and donate **90% of profits** generated by these tools to projects that accelerate:

1. **Energy abundance** – fusion, solar, grid-scale storage  
2. **Food autonomy** – vertical farming, precision fermentation  
3. **Universal healthcare** – open R&D for medicine and diagnostics  
4. **Education access** – open-source curricula & devices

(We especially encourage AI research in each of these fields.)
