Every line of code here is MIT-licensed, forkable, remixable — designed to collapse the gap between *idea* and *impact*.
Fork it, improve it, run your business on it!

## Core Tools

These general tools which drive the rest of our infrastructure. They are designed to be fast, efficient and (relatively) easy to use.

| Name | Purpose | License |
|------|---------|---------|
| **[Ensemble](https://github.com/just-every/ensemble)** | Unified interface to all major LLMs. | MIT |
| **[Task](https://github.com/just-every/task)** | Expands Ensemble to perform intelligent, reflective, task execution. | MIT |
| **[Magi](https://github.com/just-every/magi)** | Orchestrates Tasks with a persistent chain of thought - Mostly Autonomous Generative Intelligence. | MIT |


## Focused Tools

These tools are designed for specific tasks and outcomes.

| Name | Purpose | License |
|------|---------|---------|
| **[MCP Tools](https://github.com/orgs/just-every/repositories?q=mcp)** | We publish a number of MCP tools to help speed up development. | MIT |
| **[Search](https://github.com/just-every/search)** | A powerful search engine which runs on all major providers at once. | MIT |
| **[Crawl](https://github.com/just-every/crawl)** | Quickly read pages or sites and turn them into markdown. | MIT |
| **[Code Context](https://github.com/just-every/code-context)** | Analyses your repository's architecture and history, unlocking truly autonomous code integration. | MIT |
| **[Benchmark](https://github.com/just-every/benchmark)** | Runs benchmarks on Ensemble and Task to compare models and features. | MIT |


## Post-Scarcity Pledge

We believe, that with the right direction **AI can create post-scarcity** — a world where hunger, homelessness, and preventable disease are solved problems. That might sound like utopia, but two years ago today's tech looked like science fiction.

We're well past the point where regulation can catch up. The only way out is through — faster, more open, more intentional. We must build tools that solve the problems they create.

**If you're building commercially:**
You’re not required to, but we ask you to consider joining our Post-Scarcity Pledge and donate **90% of profits** generated by these tools to projects that accelerate:

1. **Energy abundance** – fusion, solar, grid-scale storage  
2. **Food autonomy** – vertical farming, precision fermentation  
3. **Universal healthcare** – open R&D for medicine and diagnostics  
4. **Education access** – open-source curricula & devices

(We especially encourage AI research in each of these fields.)
