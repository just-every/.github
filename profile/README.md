# JustEvery_

We build AI tools in the open — not for profit, but for *everyone*.

> [!WARNING]
> The current trajectory of AI is clear: accelerating centralization of capital and catastrophic inequality. If we stay this course, the wealth generated by AI will serve the few while displacing billions.

We believe, that with the right direction **AI can create post-scarcity** — a world where hunger, homelessness, and preventable disease are solved problems. That might sound like utopia, but two years ago today's tech looked like science fiction.

We're well past the point where regulation can catch up. The only way out is through — faster, more open, more intentional. We must build tools that solve the problems they create.

**If you're building commercially:**
You’re not required to, but we ask you to join our Profit Pledge and donate **90% of profits** generated by these tools to projects that accelerate:

1. **Energy abundance** – fusion, solar, grid-scale storage  
2. **Food autonomy** – vertical farming, precision fermentation  
3. **Universal healthcare** – open R&D for medicine and diagnostics  
4. **Education access** – open-source curricula & devices

(We especially encourage AI research in each of these fields.)

## Core Tools

These general tools which drive the rest of our infrastructure. They are designed to be fast, efficient and (relatively) easy to use.

| Name | Purpose | License |
|------|---------|---------|
| **[Ensemble](https://github.com/just-every/ensemble)** | Unified interface to all major LLMs. | MIT |
| **[Task](https://github.com/just-every/task)** | Expands Ensemble to perform intelligent, reflective, task execution. | MIT |
| **[Magi](https://github.com/just-every/magi)** | Orchestrates Tasks with a persistent chain of thought - Mostly Autonomous Generative Intelligence. | MIT |

Every line of code here is MIT-licensed, forkable, remixable — designed to collapse the gap between *idea* and *impact*.
Fork it, improve it, run your business on it!

> [!TIP]
> Our ultimate goal is to enable Magi to self improve - to become Gödel machine, if you like - so that progress can continue faster than we can push it ourselves. While we don't have billions of dollars, we do have an open community and the ability to leverage public SOTA models from *every* provider, all at once.

## Focused Tools

These tools are designed for specific tasks and outcomes.

| Name | Purpose | License |
|------|---------|---------|
| **[App](https://github.com/just-every/app)** | Build just every... app! | AGPLv3 |
| **[Manager](https://github.com/just-every/manager)** | Helps you manage yourself and your team. | AGPLv3 |
| **[Design](https://github.com/just-every/design)** | Performs the role of a professional designer. | AGPLv3 |
| **[Search](https://github.com/just-every/search)** | A powerful search engine which runs on all major providers at once. | MIT |
| **[MCP Tools](https://github.com/orgs/just-every/repositories?q=mcp)** | We publish a number of MCP tools which help speed up development. | MIT |

Some of these tools are more commerical and licensed under AGPLv3. We absolutely still enourage forks, PRs and commerical use. However if you run one of the AGPLv3 tools for users over a network, you must publish your source too. This ensures that the most commerically beneficial tools are available for all.
